    Alignment of possessor permanently changed to that of item
    Charisma of possessor reduced to 3 as long as item is owned
    Fear reaction possible in any creature within 20' of the item whenever a major or primary power is used (all, including possessor, must save versus magic or flee in panic)
    Fumble reaction possible in any creature within 20' of the item whenever a major or primary power is used (all, including possessor, must save versus magic or drop any held items)
    Greed and covetousness reaction in all intelligent creatures viewing the item (save versus magic or attack possessor and steal the item; associates are only 25% likely to have to check; henchmen check loyalty first, failure then requires saving throw as above)
    Lycanthropy inflicted upon the possessor (type according to alignment of item, change to animal form involuntary and 50% likely (1 check only) whenever confronted and attacked by an enemy)
    Treasure within 5' radius of mineral nature (metal or gems) of non-magical type is reduced by 20-80% as the item consumes it to sustain its power
    User becomes ethereal whenever any major or primary power of the item is activated (there is a 5% cumulative chance that he or she will thereafter become ethereal whenever a stress (combat, life-or-death, difficult problem involving the user's decision) situation exists; the ethereal state lasts until stress is removed)
    User becomes fantastically strong (18/00, 19 if 18/00 already) but very clumsy (dexterity is reduced by as many points as strength was increased, and so no "to hit" bonuses are allowed for strength, and a -2 for clumsiness is given instead; furthermore, the individual must be checked as if he or she has a Fumble spell cast upon him or her whenever any item is handled or spell is to be cast by the user)
    User cannot touch or be touched by any (even magical) metal (metal simply passes through his or her body as if it did not exist and has no effect)
    User has a poison touch which requires that humans and man-sized humanoids (but not undead) save versus poison whenever touched
    User has limited omniscience and may request the DM to answer 1 question per game day (answer is given with limitations set by DM's discretion, with overall campaign factors and knowledge of player vs player character overriding considerations)
    User has short-duration super charismatic effect upon creatures of the same basic alignment (they will willingly join and serve the character for 1-4, 2-8, or 3-12 turns, depending on how exact the alignment match is; thereafter the effect of the dweomer wears off and the creatures will no longer serve due to realization of the enchantment and fear of it)
    Temperature within a 6" radius is raised 20-50 deg F for 2-12 turns whenever any power of the item is used (moves with item)
    Temperature within a 6" radius is lowered 20-80 deg F for 2-12 turns whenever the major or prime power of the item is used (moves with item)
    Whenever the prime power is used the possessor must save versus magic or lose 1 level of experience
    Whenever the prime power is used those creatures friendly to the user within 20' (excluding the user) will sustain 5-20 hit points of damage
    Whenever this item is used as a weapon to strike an enemy it does double normal damage to the opponent but the wielder takes normal damage just as if he or she had been struck by the item
